This DIY project receives ADS-B signals from nearby flights and feeds the signal to several flight tracker websites, including FlightRadar24, FlightAware, RadarBox, and Variflight. Alternatively, a 3.5-inch screen displays information in real-time, including feeder status, hourly-updated METAR, and current antenna gain. An iPhone Widget also shows the number of flight-on-radar. This project was developed based on [AirNav RadarBox XRange 2](https://www.amazon.com/AirNav-RadarBox-XRange2-Enhanced-Receiver/dp/B08DJB4BXM).
