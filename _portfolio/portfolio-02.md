This team design project (also known as Team Design Project and Skills, or TDPS) presents an intelligent rover design capable of automatically completing six tasks on East Lake patios, UESTC, within the budget of 1,000 RMB. 

Our designed rover is equipped with a mbed Nucleo-L432KC as the central controller, an OpenMV camera and four ultrasonic detectors as its sensors, and two robotic arms for completing the tasks. This rover features its customised PCB design, practical deck and mast design, a Bluetooth receiver with GUI, and AI-based gravel recognition algorithms. With the help of a highly-sensitive closed-loop feedback system and finetuned motors, our rover travelled smoothly on patio one and completed all tasks within 200 seconds. Another ultrasonic-based robust feedback system, together with a classic yet advanced shape detection algorithm, ensured the rover finished all tasks on patio two within 240 seconds. The total budget of this project was 998.84 RMB.

## My Contributions
 - Organised weekly meetings
 - Developed a novel AI-based gravel recognition algorithm and manually implemented on an OpenMV microcontroller
 - Proposed an ultrasonic angular proportional controlling algorithm
 - Reduced 90% of systematic error of an onboard magnetometer by ellipsoidal fitting and matrix factorisation
 - Organised and synthesised group assessed materials
